# TODO

## NEXT RELEASE

- netlify.toml convert task to gulp
- cleanup config - do not use enviroment variables????

    - base with srcdoc does not work so what do we do?
    - firefox - when you change something and then reload and reload again it will not come back to previous state
        - maybe add some caching headers?
    - think more about inline snippets and how to display them (iframes have fixed height)
    - add bigger snippets where we can display html & css & js next to each other (on bigger screen widths)
    - maybe we do not need inline snippets?
    - in config
        - have a way to disable some controls / hide some tabs that are not necessary
        - have a way to set height of snippet (probably in config?)

            - when serving this file add relevant headers
            - do not add any other extra headers like powered by and security headers added by helmet??
                - somebody could then display our content? maybe only add the one which disables displaying in iframe?

    - add gradient overlay on code blocks that overflow to y
    - in parseArticle function have functions which checks article for correctness
        - check if paragraphs start with capital letter and end with dot
        - check of headings start with capital letter
        - check YAML header for correctness
        - check that all relative url's start with `./` (or do not start with)

    - add checks in upload script so it checks if
        - url's are unique
        - id's are unique
        - directory month/year fits the publication date directories
    - flatten directory structure, just use years directories
    - add rel="noopener" to links to other domains
        - https://jakearchibald.com/2016/performance-benefits-of-rel-noopener/
        - write article about this
    - refactor styles
    - add article footer with
        - share on twitter and facebook
        - edit this article on github
            - or maybe what could be really cool would be if there was live edit and anyone could submit edit
        - similar articles and next article
    - refactor upload script, put id into articles so we have truly unique identificator?
