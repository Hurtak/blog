- Frontend
    - http://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#whitespace-control
    - minify scripts & css (debug mode in production still with unminified files)

    - revisit rss feed items
    - sticky footer
    - add compilation process for static files
    - consider loading images with javascript with <noscript> fallback?

    - consider adding critical css
    - sprites for images/icons

    - have all relevant metatags, inspire with jecas.cz and ponyfoo.com
    - console easter egg, or perhaps something inside HTML? http://codepen.io/elijahmanor/pen/RPjeLz?editors=001
    - consider switching to async templating engine with streaing support (markojs by ebay, dustjs by linkedin)

## NICE TO HAVE
- cron job to detect 404 links
- cron job to automatically git fetch changes & update new articles
- switch to templating engine which supports streaming
- own comment system?
- evaluate switch from express to alternatives (koa, hapi)
    - once async/await hits node consider switching to koa2
    - https://github.com/llambda/koa-boiler (http2, caching...)
- serve static files from nginx

## LONG TERM
- once standard supports ES6 + Async/Await:
    - remove "standard" from package.json
    - remove "babel-eslint" dependency
- once we have object spread operator replace Object.assign in addCommonData function in routes.js
