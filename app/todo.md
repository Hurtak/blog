  - currently html of code blocks is parsed and we cannot get raw html? so `<h2>` will become `<h2></h2>`, maybe switch to jsdom?
  - in parseArticle function have functions which checks article for correctness
    - check if paragraphs start with capital letter and end with dot
    - check of headings start with capital letter

  - add checks in upload script so it checks if
    - url's are unique
    - id's are unique
    - directory month/year fits the publication date directories
  - flatten directory structure, just use years directories

## NICE TO HAVE
- switch to templating engine which supports streaming
- own comment system?
- evaluate switch from express to alternatives (koa, hapi)
  - once async/await hits node consider switching to koa2
  - https://github.com/llambda/koa-boiler (http2, caching...)
- serve static files from nginx

## LONG TERM
- once standard supports ES6 + Async/Await:
  - remove "standard" from package.json
  - remove "babel-eslint" dependency
- once we have object spread operator replace Object.assign in addCommonData function in routes.js
