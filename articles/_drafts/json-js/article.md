## Title

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is an open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data.

JSON is a language-independent data format that was derived from JavaScript

Although Douglas Crockford originally asserted that JSON is a strict subset of JavaScript, his specification actually allows valid JSON documents that are invalid JavaScript. Specifically, JSON allows the Unicode line terminators U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR and U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR to appear unescaped in quoted strings, while JavaScript does not.
